## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **MineServer**. We believe running a Minecraft server shouldn't require a degree in networking or hours of config file editing. Whether you're a parent setting up a world for your kids, a streamer playing with viewers, or a power user managing a modded SMP, MineServer is built for **you**.

Powered by **Rust** 🦀 and **Tauri** 🚀, it's incredibly lightweight (using less RAM than a web browser tab) while giving you professional-grade tools wrapped in a beautiful, modern interface.

## 🌟 Why MineServer?

### 🚀 **Performance First**
Forget clunky Electron apps that eat your RAM. MineServer is native. It opens instantly, runs silently in the background, and leaves your system resources free for what matters—gaming.

### 🛡️ **Security Center (Guardian)**
We take security seriously. With features like **Tunnel Guard**, we actively monitor connections to ensure your home network stays safe while you play with friends. The built-in **Panic Mode** lets you instantly lock down your server if griefers join.

### 🎥 **Streamer Friendly**
Streaming? Turn on **Streamer Mode** to automatically mask your Public IP, coordinates, and sensitive server details from your dashboard. Show your screen without fear of leaking your IP.
